# Unit2.FreelancerForum

- We have an array with the freelancers' name, price, and occupation
- Each freelancer's information should populate every 5 seconds
- When a new freelancer's info appears, the average starting price should also update
- When it reaches the end of the array, is there a way to clear it and make it start again from the top?

- Create a function that gets a random freelancer's info from the array
- Set that function as the argument for setInterval() so it runs every 5 seconds
